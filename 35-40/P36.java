	Scooby and Beautiful Strings
	
	Scooby doo likes beautiful strings. Scooby doo calls a string 'S' beautiful if there exists a String 'T' such that S=T+T, where '+' represents the concatenation of the two strings. "aabaab","aa","" are some examples of beautiful strings. Now scooby gives a string s to Shaggy and and asks him to find out the longest beautiful string that can be obtained from s by erasing some of its characters. (Possibly none or in the worst case erasing all the characters). In other words scooby wants the longest beautiful string that occurs in s as a subsequence. Shaggy is a noob with strings and thus needs your help. Help Shaggy by returning the length of the longest possible beautiful string that can be obtained from given string s. 

	Constraints: Number of testcases 1<=T<=150 Length of String 1<=s<=100 Sample 

	Input: aabbab 
	Sample Output: 4
	Explanation: abab is the subsequence that is a beautiful string and has length 4. Therefore the answer is 4. Also it can be seen that there is no beautiful string with length greater than 4.
